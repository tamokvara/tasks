    <div class="conteiner1"> <h4 class="h41">What is Lorem Ipsum?</h4>
<p>
    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <br> 
    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the <br>
    1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to <br> 
    make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also <br> 
    the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was <br> 
    popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing <br> 
    Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software <br>
    like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. <br>

<h4 class="42">Why do we use it?</h4>
<p class="p2">It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable <br> 
    content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum <br> 
    is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to <br> 
    using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many <br> 
    desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum <br> 
    as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many <br> 
    web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, <br> 
    sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the <br> like).

 <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock,<br> 
    a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites <br> 
    of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of <br> 
    Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor <br> 
    sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p> <br>

  <p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero <br> 
    are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>
