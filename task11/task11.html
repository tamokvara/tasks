    <h3>Why do we use it?</h3> <br>
    <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be <br> 
        distracted by the readable content of a page when <br> 
        looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum <br> 
        is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of <br> 
        letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content <br> 
        here', making it look like readable English. Many <br> 
        desktop publishing packages and web page editors <br> 
        now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, <br> 
        and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many <br> 
        web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have <br> 
        evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,<br> 
        sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the <br> like).</p> <br>
